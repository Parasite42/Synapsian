# Synapsian
A repository for the study of the Synapsian language<br />
This is a personal repository of information forked from Yari's repo on Synapsian. I will try to keep it up to date with information i find and learn about synapsian, as i noticed the current repository has been out of date for about 3 years now, and i have access to a broken wiki backup that is 2 years old and a more up to date website, which i will be pulling some info over from. <br />
You can find the github page here: https://parasite42.github.io/Synapsian/ <br />
# Who are you?
My name is Engee 3842, i'm just a sporadically curious migrant that wanted to learn a bit more, but who will say if this Repo will stay up to date?<br />
