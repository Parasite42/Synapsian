# Synapsian
This is a fork of the Synapsian Research hub created by Yari, and other archivists in 2017. Following the shutdown of the systemspace website, this research hub has fallen into disrepair. It still holds useful information, so I have taken it upon myself to reimplement and potentially expand on its contents.<br />
You can find the github page here: https://parasite42.github.io/Synapsian/ <br />
# Who are you?
For verification purposes, my name is Engee #3842. I forked this repo realizing that it has been out of date for at least 3 years. This is a vain attempt at trying to keep it up to date, as well as fixing and adding new images to the Github pages.<br />
# What happened to TSUKI?
After Project Miracle Ribbon's success in 2018, the TSUKI Project remained within Active zones 1-2 until its quiet and sudden closure around the end of 2019. This confused community migrants who resided in the officially run TSUKICHAT. As of May 2020, the Tsuki Representative remains MIA.
